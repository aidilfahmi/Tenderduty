Tenderduty is a comprehensive monitoring tool for Tendermint chains. Its primary function is to alert a validator if they are missing blocks, and has many other features.

v2 is complete rewrite of the original tenderduty graciously sponsored by the [Osmosis Grants Program](https://grants.osmosis.zone/). This new version adds a web dashboard, prometheus exporter, telegram and discord notifications, multi-chain support, more granular alerting, and more types of alerts.
